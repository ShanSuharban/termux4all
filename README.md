## Introduction to termux4all project

termux4all is not a project or something. This is some packages that can be used for the development and security 
purposes on android phone using the termux app itself.
The main purpose of this is to aware about android users 'what we can do with a simple android phone'.After reading all 
these you will understand that our android phone is also a powerful tool for learning tech stuffs like we are normally
done in computers or laptops.
Another purpose of this project is to install all the important tools in termux without researching a lot .If you have limited time and install all the important tools according to the category like development tools/security tools/ editors etc.This automated script will allow to install all those packages rather than searching the packages correct name and repeatedly type 'apt install' command on termux.

Disclaimer: "The creator of 'termux4all' is not responsible for any misuse, harm, or illegal activities resulting from the user's use. Please be responsible and respect others' privacy when using the tools provided in the 'Security Tools' section. I have only automated the installation step, so use them exclusively for ethical and educational purposes."

Note: "I only included the software packages in the file that are available in the Termux repository, not in other repositories like proot-distro or nethunter (both) for development. But for security purpose, you should install proot-distro or kali nethunter.Because termux default not support any security tools. I will explain it soon"

Important Note: "Everyone should install the basic packages on Termux ( Both for Development & Security ).
If you are complete beginner and who dont have laptop/computer for learning and other purposes then you can use termux 
app to push your limits and can learn a lot of different things which normally cant done by any other app.Its an one & 
only powerful app for android. 
This is the complete oneshot of Termux App .After reading all these sections you will understand almost everything usecases about the App and when you look the "packages list & uses" section i created below .Your mind will blown up.
## Intro to Termux App
![termuxlogo](https://github.com/ShanSuharban/termux4all/assets/95335433/d29597dd-9d4e-4651-a36a-53cc18ccb9db)

Termux is a free and open-source terminal emulator for Android (without root) that allows you to run a Linux environment on your Android device.
Termux is an Android app that transforms your smartphone or tablet into a fully-featured Linux terminal. It's like having a mini-computer in your pocket.

## Why Termux App is used

Termux serves various purposes, including development and security, among others. You can learn many things from this simple app instead of installing numerous apps from the Play Store or other third-party sources.
If you're a beginner without access to a laptop or computer and have only an Android phone for coding or other purposes, then Termux is the ideal app for you. It enables you to do amazing things for both learning and fun. You can also explore numerous other use cases for Termux on the internet.
Yes, Termux is currently better than any other apps available on the internet. I can't say it will always be the case, but for now, it's a top choice.

For more details about Termux, you can visit: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page

## Termux App for Developers
If you want to learn different programming languages, you'd typically need to install separate apps from the Play Store or use different online compilers for each language. In contrast, Termux allows you to install multiple languages like Python, C++, Go, etc., and run them all from a single terminal. It's that simple!
Termux has no limits. You can learn various things like Linux commands, SSH, web development, and more from this single app. It's an exciting tool for anyone interested in coding without a laptop or computer.
You can also connect your Linux system to Termux via SSH and have complete control over your system through Termux. No need to install a separate SSH app like JuiceSSH or ConnectBot from the Play Store.
I even used Termux to connect to my Raspberry Pi (a pocket computer) by powering it with a power bank, putting it in my bag, and remotely connecting to it via SSH through Termux. This way, I could perform various tasks without needing a screen.
## Termux App for Hackers
Ethical Hacking is not as we see in movies and green screen with a person typing very rapidly and just hack anything before we understand what is going on.
Ethical Hacking is part of Computer Security, No system on earth is secure all you just need is to out of box approach to get in.
You can use Termux for security testing purposes. You can install basic security tools like Nmap and Metasploit and other scripts from GitHub (Python, Bash, or other scripts) to conduct tests. However, there's a limitation with security tools on Termux: you can't use all the options available for the tools unless you root your phone.Before few years Termux supported the security testing packages but as for now termux dont support any security package by default.That means you can't install & setup security tools on normal termux unless you setup proot-distro or nethunter rootless.
Rooting your phone means unlocking complete permissions, essentially giving you full control over your device, including system files and settings that are typically hidden from regular users.
So, if you want to use Termux for advanced security testing, you should consider rooting your phone. This will allow you to install a wide range of packages and even other apps for security purposes, such as those available in the Nethunter store.
If you're interested in security testing with your Android phone, I recommend rooting your phone and installing Kali Nethunter, a project by Offensive Security that lets you install Kali Linux on Android, either with or without root access. I'll provide more detailed information in the "Termux for Advanced Users" section.
## Why Termux Removed Popular Hacking Tools
Termux Developers removed all the Security packages on their repository. I dont complaint Termux App for the removal of popular security packages because they have their own reason for that. Lot of people use Termux App not for learning security purposes .They just used for the Privacy Violation,Fraud,Phishing ,SMS Bombing, Insta-Bruteforce, Facebook-Bruteforce etc and put it as their Whatsapp Status or Instagram Story. Im not saying i never used any tools on it . I did it when i started in Termux but i never put it on social media status or whatever. I only tested with my own not just others. I will share more details about this on 'My Experiences On Termux App Session'.
A lot of content creators mis-spread Termux as a tool for spamming,phishing & other offensive activities  via social media platforms .Even some kids installed 'cmatrix' & 'hollywood' packages on Termux and they themselves pretend to be a hacker & put it on social media's to show off. But All this affect the Termux App ,Developers & the community itself.Even Mature communities of Linux enthusiasts & other tech experts often recognize this project as "script kiddie"Â due to above reasons.
More details can found on:

https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Hacking

## Can We Install & Use Hacking Tools on Termux
Obviously .Termux indirectly supports the security tools via proot-distro or nethunter .The way Termux did it is really interesting & appreciatable .Because in this way a normal script-kiddie or persons without really interested or knowledge can't install and setup that. You can install security tools on Termux app via proot-distro or kali nethunter. Termux also provides proot-distro package on their repository .So we can install all setup all security tools on proot-distro . I will explain it soon on "Termux For Advanced User's Session".
## How to Install Termux on Android Phone
Dont install termux from playstore .It have some issues with android 10 and also issues with updating and upgrading.Also you dont need to buy additional plugins of termux from playstore .All are free on github and fdroid

( Note: Again"Im not saying  you will become a better pentester or security expert after using all the tools.Cybersecurity is not just about using automated tools or scripts .You can't become a security expert or developer by using termux app , its a lot more than that .You should develop a lot of other different skills and you actually need a good computer or lap inorder to become a good developer or security expert.But atleast you can learn the fundamentals & basics of security like linux commands,commonly used tools in security etc through this app. Thats actually not a bad  if you are really interested in your domain " .)

Important Note: " Only install packages according to your learning purpose .You can also install a lot of other security tools on it .But i only prefer you to install nethunter for security because termux is not perfectly suited for security testing .Even with the proot-distro you may experience some issues when using the above listed tools , so don't blame me for that issues, i only automated the installation command. Thats why im not providing a lot of security tools in the above list".

## Termux for Advanced Users
You cant install all tools supported by linux on termux because termux download & install all packages on its own repository. Not all linux packages are in the repo
## Limitation of Termux
The problem with termux is you cant install all packages that contained on linux with termux .So in that case you should install a linux shell (ubuntu, kali, ...) on termux.
The one reason for that is termux is based on arm architecture.for example , if i use linux on raspberry pi or any sbc like bananapi,rockpi ,orangepi etc ,it is arm architectures file. arm architecture is more commonly found in mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, as well as embedded systems and some low-power laptops. ARM processors are designed for efficiency and power savings, making them well-suited for portable and battery-powered devices. So the problem is all high end softwares or some softwares that can normally installed on pc/lap cant install and work with raspberry pi or arm based platforms like in our case our termux. It is run on a mobile so its an arm based platform.So we cant do nothing about that because arm based architectures are not developed for that level purpose like pc/lap .All softwares are not developed for arm platforms.
The other reason is itself termux because we are already limited by arm architecture itself and the termux  install all packages from termux repository .
"Termux repository" refers to the official repository of packages and software that can be installed using the Termux package manager (apt,pkg).
## How to Overcome Termux Default Limitation
The Termux repo may not have as extensive a collection of packages as the repositories of major Linux distributions. Some or less commonly used software might not be available in the Termux repo.
Termux operates within its own isolated environment on Android and doesn't integrate deeply with the underlying Android system. In contrast, Linux distributions are designed to be tightly integrated with the hardware and system libraries, providing more seamless performance and compatibility.

Termux runs on top of the Android kernel and is subject to its limitations. It may not support all hardware features and device drivers that a standard Linux distribution running on dedicated hardware would.

-> more details found on termux official site: 
       https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux
## How to install & setup proot on Termux
'proot' in Termux is a way to create a separate, controlled space within your Android device. Inside this space, you can run Linux programs and experiment with them without affecting your Android system. It's like having a mini Linux world inside your phone, where you can play around with Linux tools safely without root.By this way you can install softwares that normally cant install in the default termux repo.

 `Proot` in Termux like a magic box. When you use it, you create a small "Linux playground" inside your phone. In this playground, you can use Linux tools without messing up your regular phone stuff. It's like a hidden room where you can play with Linux, and it won't change anything on your phone. It's like having a secret Linux world in your Termux app.

You can push termux default limits by installing & setting up proot in termux for both development and security purposes.
-> proot & chroot (a tool for creating isolated environments): 
-> chroot: Typically requires root (superuser) privileges to change the apparent root directory of a process. It's a kernel-level feature.
Chroot provides a stricter form of isolation by changing the apparent root directory for a process. It offers a higher level of separation between the chroot environment and the host system.
Proot can be used without root access because it's a user-space tool that emulates certain system calls. It's designed for non-root users.
Using `chroot` is like modifying a room's structure, which needs special access (root), while `proot` is similar to rearranging furniture to create a separate area within the room, and it doesn't require any special access.
If you have rooted device and want to have a better experience with using the Linux distributions in Termux, then useÂ chroot because it isolates at system level.
## For Developers
-> To install & setup proot on termux. Type the below commands.
 '''

                    apt install proot proot-distro -y
-> You can list available  linux distro by following command.
'''

                    proot-distro list 
-> after this command , you can see some available linux distro on termux.

ex:

   Alpine Linux (edge)  --> alpine
   
   Arch Linux -->  archlinux
   
   Debian (stable) --> debian
   
   Fedora 35 --> fedora
   
   Manjaro AArch64 --> manjaro-aarch64
   
   OpenSUSE -->  opensuse
   
   Ubuntu (22.04) --> ubuntu
   
   Void Linux  --> void

-> Choose the distro by following command.
'''

        proot-distro install distro_name
        proot-distro install ubuntu  
-> To enter this proot-distro shell. Type the below command.
'''

        proot-distro login distro_name
        proot-distro login ubuntu    
Congrats.You now installed & entered into proot-distro shell .Now you can install packages that are normally not available in termux repository. This includes both development & security packages.

(You can also install desktop environments for the proot-distro . For ie : if i installed ubuntu on termux with proot-distro .I can also install desktop-environment such us xfce, gnome etc on termux .So i can use its graphical user interface like your normal linux desktop . For that gui purpose i should install and setup vncserver on ubuntu and vncviewer app for android . But i dont recommend because it will take a lot of time & space for installation and its difficult if your phone's display is small .Be better with cli its more effective than gui)
## For Hackers
For security testing  I recommend kali nethunter (an opensource project by offensive security to install kali linux on android with/without root) 

( Kali Linux : Kali Linux is a free linux based operating system developed by offensive security that helps you learn about computer security and how to keep systems safe from hackers. It's like a training tool for people interested in CyberSecurity,CyberForensics & InfoSec professionals. 
-> You can find the more details of kali linux here: 

        https://www.kali.org/docs/                                                                         )
        
## How to Install Hacking Tools on Termux without Nethunter
But in case you want to install popular security tools on termux without nethunter ( because nethunter itself need a lot of space for installation & setup ( minimum16 gb). I would prefer install proot-distro first and install all your security tools on it.Thats the better way.

The same steps I mentioned in the developer section are also applicable to security. First, you need to install proot-distro and then install any Linux distro within proot-distro. After that, log in with proot-distro, clone this repository, and run the 't4all.sh' file. You will find four different options: development, security, editors, and cool packages. Choose 'security' and install the packages according to your needs. You can also install all the packages in each section and all sections.
## How to Install Hacking Tools on Termux with Nethunter (both)
I dont explain the installation of kali nethunter (both) in this section .Because its a long process for both and  this explanation will go oooooon.

## My Experiences on Termux App 
(just read it if u have time & interested) :

My journey with the Termux app, or "My Termux Story," has been quite a ride. I've been using this app for a while, and I'd like to share my experiences as someone who started with little knowledge about hacking ,Programming & Linux.
When I first opened Termux, I saw a basic black screen with no user-friendly options. Terms like "CLI" or "terminal" were foreign to me at the time. I ended up watching random YouTube videos and copying commands without truly understanding them. Essentially, I was a newbie, using other people's projects and tools without really knowing how they worked.

However, as I continued, I ran into many errors. Fixing these issues required me to search on Google and watch YouTube tutorials, but it also pushed me to learn more about Linux and the tools I was using. I kept using Termux because it had a bunch of fun hacking tools like Instagram brute-forcing, SMS bombing, Facebook hacking, cmatrix, and more. I was fascinated by the tool interfaces and what they could do.
To be good at  Termux, I knew I had to start from scratch and learn Linux basics. I watched YouTube tutorials and read articles to get the basics down. This time, I was genuinely interested in learning, not just copying and pasting commands. I also learned more Linux commands beyond the basics.

I played around with various GitHub repositories, cloning and setting up projects in Termux. However, I faced even more errors, from version mismatches (Python2 vs. Python) to module and package issues. These errors were my teachers, pushing me to become a better Termux and Linux user.

For beginners using Termux, here's some advice: don't get discouraged by errors. Errors related to packages and installations are common, especially when dealing with heavy tools like "Nethunter Rootless." Instead of giving up, use these errors as chances to learn. Search on Google and YouTube for solutions, and try to understand why these issues occur. This way, you'll develop valuable troubleshooting skills, just like I did.
I also explored other things, like solving "TryHackMe" challenges using Termux and Nethunter, as well as using Termux for programming. Back then, I was new to programming and didn't have a computer or laptop. Termux became my all-in-one tool for learning C and C++. Some friends even tried web development and experimented with programming languages like Go, Ruby, and Python using Termux. Additionally, I installed "Metasploit-Framework," a cybersecurity toolkit, and used it to tackle TryHackMe challenges.

As you can see, I learned the fundamentals of technology and programming using an old Android phone and the Termux app. The Linux basics I picked up in Termux proved invaluable when I got my Raspberry Pi, a small and affordable computer with various applications in computer science and other fields. Even with my Raspberry Pi, I continued to use Termux as my primary tool for remote control through SSH, securely managing my Raspberry Pi. This setup allowed me to carry my Raspberry Pi in my bag, powered by a portable charger, while controlling it using Termux on my phone. I could perform tasks like wireless penetration testing with this mobile setup, and it felt like a tech marvel.

In conclusion, this section is dedicated to the Termux app, which played a crucial role in my learning journey. I'm incredibly grateful to the app's developer and the Termux community for creating and maintaining this fantastic tool. If you've read this far, I genuinely thank you because reading is becoming less common in our fast-paced world. In summary, always challenge yourself, no matter what you're pursuing.
